# Empirical Analysis Of Sorting Algorithms
The objective of this project is to compare the theoretical analysis of sorting algorithms with empirical analysis.

The analyzed algorithms were: Insertion Sort, Selection Sort, Merge Sort, Heap Sort, and Quick Sort.
The analysis consists of samples ranging from 2^10 to 2^30 in size, or until an error occurs.
Five tests were performed with each sample to generate the average, median, and standard deviation of the test cases.
